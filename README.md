# SathiBhai

# Introduction
Our project is a web application designed to foster
cultural connections among students of Howard
University. The project is called "SathiBhai"("SathiBhai"
is a combination of two terms "Sathi" which means
friend and â€œBhai" which means brotherly relation.It
categorizes users by their country of origin and
integrates with university-affiliated cultural associations
to post events and information relevant to each cultural
group.

While platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn cater to a wide range of social and professional
interactions, SathiBhai is specifically tailored for cultural exchange within the university
community. This focused purpose creates a more immersive and targeted experience for
users interested in connecting with others based on cultural interests.SathiBhai requires
personalized connection requests, promoting more genuine and meaningful interactions
compared to the often superficial connections on platforms like Instagram. For individuals who
prioritize quality over quantity in their social interactions, this feature can be particularly
appealing.By using university email addresses for registration, SathiBhai offers enhanced
privacy and security measures compared to platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn. This can
be reassuring for individuals who are concerned about their online privacy or who may be
hesitant to share personal information on social media.
